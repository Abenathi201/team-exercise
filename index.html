                <h3>What is an apocalypse?</h3>
                <p>
                    The word "apocalypse" is known as synonym for catastrophe, which means the end
                    world the world be it through human actions impacting the world negatively to its

                <h3>Cybergeddon</h3>
                <p>
                    This a potential sabotage of computer every computer network, activites and systems.
                    Cyber terrosism or cyber warfare can lead to wide a scale cataclysm that could cause
                    internet disruption and economic colapse.

                <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                    <p>
                        scientist. NASA says in just the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of 
                        glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 7,000 years 
                        ago.Earth's average surface temperature has risen about 0.9°C since the late 19th century
                        largely down to increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions. Most of that 
                        warming has been in the last 35 years, and the five warmest years on record have occurred 
                        since 2010. That'll play havoc with our world. It wouldn't be the end of us, but we would 
                        be up the figurative creek without a paddle. And it's already happening.
                        This one everyone can agree with, if don't it means you disagree with 97% of climate

                <h3>Pandemic</h3>
                <p>
                    Something we all do not want. Infamous pandemics include the Spanish Flu, which infected 500 
                    million people in 1918-20 and killed 50 million, and the devastating HIV pandemic, another 
                    seemingly unstoppable force in the1980s, which still affects us now. If something similar were 
                    to happen again, and we couldn't find a way to stop or control it, mankind could be decimated 
                    as it spreads throughout the world.
